# GPU Polyphase Filterbank for Streaming Radioastronomy

This project includes the CUDA programs for processing data from a telescope. It is developed as part of the master thesis of Nina Herrmann. 

The GPU implementation is separated into two main parts:  **low-level implementations** and **high-level implementations**.
Complementary a CPU program is part of the repository.

## Low-level Implementations
The implementation idea is taken from [1](https://zenodo.org/record/2587752#.XTVmc3vgpaQ) and the following conferences/proceedings: [2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/arXiv:1804.05335),[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02647),[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10855),[5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09704),[6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07343)

However, for using the programm inside a real system you just need the `CriticalPolyphaseFilterbank.cu/h` files. 

This part of the project includes programs written in the CUDA API. The considered architectures are:

| GPU                | GeForce930MX               | GTX 1080                           | K80 (2Ã— GK210)                     |

| Compute Capability | 5.0                        | 6.0                                | 3.7                                |


## High-level Implementations

The considered frameworks for the high-level implementation will be Musket (Muenster Skeleton Tool). Unfortunately the framework is currently not publicly available. Skeletons provide an additional step of abstraction by including program structures for repeating problems.
