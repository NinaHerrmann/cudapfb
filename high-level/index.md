## High-level Implementations

This part of the project will be started when a functioning low-level implementation has been developed.

The considered frameworks for the high-level implementation will be Musket (Muenster Skeleton Tool). Unfortunately the framework is currently not publicly available. Skeletons provide an additional step of abstraction by including program structures for repeating problems.
